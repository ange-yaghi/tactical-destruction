# Tactical Destruction

This is a very primitive game I made with SDL sometime around 2013. It's definitely not my best work and while I've cleaned up the code to be presentable, it's still more or less how it was in 2013. The object of the game is to clear as many spheres from the screen as possible with one chain reaction.

## Game Mechanics
- A 2x2 (or bigger) plot of spheres each of the same color will "explode" beginning the chain reaction
- You may swap two spheres by left clicking one and then left clicking an adjacent sphere that you'd like it to swap places with
- Spheres with the same letter will always explode together
- Blue colored spheres cannot be moved
- To make planning easier, you can right click a sphere to lock it's position and mark it with a hollow circle
- Hold down a number key (0 through 9) when right clicking to mark spheres with a different color
